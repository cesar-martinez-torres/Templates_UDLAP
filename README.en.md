# 📘 Templates_UDLAP

## Introduction
This repository contains the **official templates** that students must use in the courses taught by Dr. César Martínez-Torres at the **Universidad de las Américas Puebla (UDLAP)**.  

## 🔧 How to Compile?
The recommended way is to use **[Overleaf][overleaf]**, but you can also compile locally using:  
- [Texmaker][texmaker]  
- [Visual Studio Code][vscode] + the [LaTeX Workshop][latexworkshop] extension  

## 📑 General Instructions
- Not all templates are used in every course.  
- Carefully check the assignment description to confirm which format you must use.  

## 📂 Available Templates

### 📝 Template: Final Project Report
Includes several organized folders:  
- **bib/** → contains `bibliografia.bib`. It is recommended to use a reference manager such as *JabRef* or *Zotero*.  
- **bst/** → contains `IEEEtran.bst`, which defines the IEEE Transactions citation style. **Do not modify**.  
- **codigos/** → folder to include the code used during the project. It is not recommended to include all the code directly in the document; use appendices instead.  
- **imagenes/** → folder to store images used in the document. Recommended formats: `.png` or `.eps`.  

The `main.tex` file is commented to facilitate understanding.
